Quickstart Demo
To run a simple example, you can use the file docker-compose-demo.yml

version: '3'
services:
  app:
    image: pcourbin/decidim:0.28.2
    environment:
      - DATABASE_HOST=pg
      - DATABASE_USERNAME=decidim
      - DATABASE_PASSWORD=pgpassword
      - RAILS_ENV=development
      - DB_CREATE=true
      - DB_SEED_DATA=true
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    links:
      - pg

  pg:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=decidim
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pgpassword
and run

docker-compose -f docker-compose-demo.yml up
Then, go to http://localhost:3000 (after a long wait due to creation of seed data, you can check the logs docker-compose -f docker-compose-demo.yml logs -f) and login with the users defined for seed data by Decidim:

Path	User	Password	Description
http://localhost:3000/system	system@example.org	decidim123456	A Decidim::System::Admin to log in at /system.
http://localhost:3000	admin@example.org	decidim123456	A Decidim::User acting as an admin for the organization.
http://localhost:3000	user@example.org	decidim123456	A Decidim::User that also belongs to the organization but itâ€™s a regular user.
Be careful, this a demo/test example. You can create a new organization, but you will not receive any email, even if you configure the SMTP server on the organization configuration page. So you will not be able to confirm any administrator or new user.
